# Covid Vaccine availability alert
Node.js API to find vaccination slots.
This API sends a notification to the specified telegram channel whenever a vaccine is available in the specified district.

This is a timer-triggered Azure function. It needs Azure functions runtime to run locally (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-develop-local).

The data is sourced from CoWin public APIs (https://apisetu.gov.in/public/marketplace/api/cowin).
